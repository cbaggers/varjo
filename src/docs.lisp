`[0]` Here we are defining a function called 'my-func'

`[1]` It takes 1 argument, called 'x' which has the type `:float`

`[2]` It returns a single `:float` value

`[3]` The string pattern is what will be injected into the final glsl. It
      behaves as though this pattern and the glsl for the arguments were
      passed to `format`, e.g. `(format nil \"(1.0f / ~a)\" \"2.3f\") assuming
      the glsl of the argument passed to `x` was \"2.3f\".

      The glsl for the arguments is passed to format in the order specified
      in `[1]`

      As it currently uses `format` it is legal to use other `directives` such
      as `~s` but it is not advisable as this will result in invalid glsl.

macros more 'expensive' than Common Lisps in the general sense.

  ;;
  ;; stages
  (defun make-stage
      "
`make-stage` is the function that create an object that can be passed to the
`translate` function. It takes the following arguments:

### kind

This must be one of the keywords in *stage-names*:

- :vertex
- :tessellation-control
- :tessellation-evaluation
- :geometry
- :fragment
- :compute

### in-args

Must be a list of input parameters to the stage. These are the values to which change
per element that is being processed, whether that be per vertex, fragment, patch,
instance, etc.

The input variables are defined as lists in the following fashion:

    (variable-name
     type-spec
     &rest optional-qualifier-designators [\"explicit-glsl-name\"])

Usually this looks like:

    (vert :vec4)
    (data lighting-data)
    (length :int :flat) <- flat is the qualifier in this case

If the last element of the list is a string, then that string is used as the name of the variable in the compiled GLSL. This is very rarely used and should generally be avoided.

### uniforms

This is a list of the uniforms to stage. These are the values that stay the same (are
uniform) for the duration of the pipeline.

They are defined in the same way as the above 'in-args' except that, if the type-spec
specified a struct type the following additional qualifiers are allowed:

- `:ssbo`
- `:ubo`
- `:std-140`
- `:std-430`

When targetting Vulkan the following additional qualifiers are allowed for uniforms:

- `:set`
- `:binding`
- `:push-constant` (only for struct types)

`:set` and `:binding` require an argument, so you have to specify them using a list like so:

    (:set 0)

where the second element is the value you want to set.

The result of `make-stage` is an instance of one of the subclasses of the
`stage` type.

### context

The context argument must be a list that may contain any number of symbols from
*supported-versions* as well as other lists for other context specific settings.
Context is used to specify the GLSL version to compile the stage.

Apart from GLSL versions, context can be used for specifying extension behaviour using a list in the following format:

   (:extension \"GL_ARB_some_extension\")

or:

  (:extension (\"GL_ARB_some_extension1\" :enable) \"GL_ARB_some_extension2\")

So either extensions are enabled by just passing their names as strings or a specific behaviour can be set for an extension using one of the following behaviours:

- `:enable`
- `:disable`
- `:require`
- `:warn`

Furthermore a target environment can be specified using a list in the following format:

  (:target-environment :opengl)

Allowed target environments are

- `:opengl`
- `:vulkan`

The default is environment is `:opengl`.
To enable Vulkan features you have to explicitly set `:vulkan` as the stage's target environment.

### code

This must be a list containing the forms that make up the 'body' of the stage.

It is not legal for this argument to be nil.

### stemcells-allowed (optional)

If this argument is not NIL then the compiler will allow the capture of globally
scoped variables from Common Lisp and use of `add-lisp-form-as-uniform` from
within macros. For details on how to support 'global variable capture' please see
the documentation for `with-stemcell-infer-hook` & `with-constant-inject-hook`

### primitive (optional)

This can be nil, a instance of the type 'primitive or a valid 'primitive
designator' as specified by the `valid-primitive-name-p` function.

Primitive designators are either one of the following keywords..

- `:dynamic`
- `:points`
- `:lines`
- `:iso-lines`
- `:line-loop`
- `:line-strip`
- `:lines-adjacency`
- `:line-strip-adjacency`
- `:triangles`
- `:triangle-fan`
- `:triangle-strip`
- `:triangles-adjacency`
- `:triangle-strip-adjacency`
- `:quads`

.. or a list whos first element is `:patches` and the second (and final) element
is a positive integer that is greater than 1. This specifies the length of
the patch.

Whilst this is optional in `make-stage` it must be set before being passed to
translate if the stage kind is one of the following:

- tessellation-control-stage
- tessellation-evaluation-stage
- geometry-stage

*Or* if it the first stage in the list of stages passed to `rolling-translate`
and if some of the other stages are of the above kinds.
